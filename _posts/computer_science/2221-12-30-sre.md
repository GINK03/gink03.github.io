# SRE(service reliability engineering)について
 - Developers focus on feature velocity and innovation; operators focus on reliability and consistency.
 - SRE consists of both technical and cultural practices.

## SREの諸要素
 - Customers’ experiences with your service tell you how reliable it is.
 - In many IT organizations, development and operations teams have conflicting priorities 
 - Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is the practice of balancing the velocity of development features with the risk to reliability.
 - SRE can benefit IT teams, regardless of whether they are using cloud or on-premises technology, for both large projects and daily work.

 - **Blameless postmortem**
   - Detailed documentation of an incident or outage, its root cause, its impact, actions taken to resolve it, and follow-up actions to prevent its recurrence. 
 - **Reliability**
   - The number of “good” interactions divided by the number of total interactions. This leaves you with a numerical fraction of real users who experience a service that is available and working.
 - **Error budget**
   - The amount of unreliability you are willing to tolerate.
 - **Service level indicator (SLI)**
   - A quantifiable measure of the reliability of your service from your users' perspective
 - **Service level objective (SLO)**
   - Sets the target for an SLI over a period of time.
 - **Continuous integration**
   - Building, integrating, and testing code within the development environment.
 - **Continuous delivery**
   - Deploying to production frequently, or at the rate the business chooses.
 - **Canarying** 
   - Deploying a change in service to a group of users who don’t know they are receiving the change, evaluating the impact to that group, and then deciding how to proceed.
 - **Toil**
   - Work directly tied to a service that is manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, or without enduring value, or that scales linearly as the service grows
 - **Affinity bias**
   - Tendency to gravitate toward those who are similar to you, such as with race, gender, socioeconomic background, or education level.
 - **Confirmation bias**
   - Tendency to find information, input, or data that supports your preconceived notions.
 - **Selective attention bias**
   - Tendency to pay attention to things, ideas, and input from people whom you tend to gravitate toward
 - **Labeling bias**
   - Tendency to form opinions based on how people look, dress, or appear externally
 - **Kitchen Sink/”Everything SRE” team**
   - We recommend this approach for organizations that have few applications and user journeys and where the scope is small enough that only one team is necessary, but a dedicated SRE team is needed in order to implement its practices
 - **Infrastructure team**
   - This type of team focuses on maintaining shared services and components related to infrastructure, versus an SRE team dedicated to working on services related to products, like customer-facing code
 - **Tools team**
   - This type of SRE team tends to focus on building software to help their developer counterparts measure, maintain, and improve system reliability or other aspects of SRE work, such as capacity planning
 - **Product/Application team**
   - This type of SRE team works to improve the reliability of a critical application or business area. We recommend this implementation for organizations that already have a Kitchen Sink, Infrastructure, or Tools-focused SRE team and have a key user-facing application with high reliability needs 
 - **Embedded team**
   - This team has SREs embedded with their developer counterparts, usually one per developer team in scope. The work relationship between the embedded SREs and developers tends to be project- or time-bounded and usually very hands-on, where they perform work like changing code and configuration of the services in scope
 - **Consulting team**
   - This implementation is very similar to the embedded implementation, except SRE are usually less hands-on. We recommend staffing one or two part-time consultants before you staff your first SRE team
 
## Key Points
   - The mission of SRE is to protect, provide for, and progress software and systems with consistent focus on availability, latency, performance, and capacity.
   - Understanding SRE practices and norms will help you build a common language to use when speaking with your IT teams and support your organization’s adoption of SRE both in the short and long term
   - Experienced SREs are comfortable with failure.
   - Failures are documented in postmortems, which focus on systems and processes versus people.
   - 100% reliability is the wrong target because it slows the release of new features, which is what drives your business.
   - SLOs and error budgets create shared responsibility and ownership between developers and SREs.
   - Fostering psychologically safe environments is necessary for learning and innovation in organizations.
   - Organizations developing an SRE culture should focus on creating a unified vision, determining what collaboration looks like, and sharing knowledge among teams.
   - Change is best when small and frequent.
   - Design thinking methodology has five phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
   - Prototyping culture encourages teams to try more ideas, leading to an increase in faster failures and more successes.
   - Excessive toil is toxic to the SRE role.
   - By eliminating toil, SREs can focus the majority of their time on work that will either reduce future toil or add service features.
   - Resistance to change is usually a fear of loss.
   - Present change as an opportunity, not a threat.
   - People react to change in many ways, and IT leaders need to understand how to communicate with and support each group
   - Measure reliability with good service level indicators (SLIs).
   - A good SLI correlates with user experience with your service; that is, a good SLI tells you when users are happy or unhappy.
   - Measure toil by identifying it, selecting an appropriate unit of measure, and tracking the measurements continuously.
   - Monitoring allows you to gain visibility into a system, which is a core requirement for judging service health and diagnosing your service when things go wrong.
   - Goal-setting, transparency, and data-driven decision making are key components of SRE measurement culture
   - To make truly data-driven decisions, you need to remove any unconscious biases
