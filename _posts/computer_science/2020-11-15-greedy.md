# greedyアルゴリズムについて

## 概要
 - 現在が良ければ未来も良いはず、という仮定に基づく
   - 短期的な最大となる行動を積み重ねると、最適値につくと期待できる場合に使えるアルゴリズム

## 例, コインの表現

```console
Problem Description
Task. The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value (an integer) into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10.
Input Format. The input consists of a single integer 𝑚.
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 103.
Output Format. Output the minimum number of coins with denominations 1, 5, 10 that changes 𝑚.

## 例, fractional knapsack

```console
Problem Description
Task. The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.
Input Format. The first line of the input contains the number 𝑛 of items and the capacity 𝑊 of a knapsack. The next 𝑛 lines define the values and weights of the items. The 𝑖-th line contains integers 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑤𝑖—the value and the weight of 𝑖-th item, respectively.
Constraints. 1≤𝑛≤103,0≤𝑊 ≤2·106;0≤𝑣𝑖 ≤2·106,0<𝑤𝑖 ≤2·106 forall1≤𝑖≤𝑛.Allthe numbers are integers.
Output Format. Output the maximal value of fractions of items that fit into the knapsack. The absolute value of the difference between the answer of your program and the optimal value should be at most 10−3. To ensure this, output your answer with at least four digits after the decimal point (otherwise your answer, while being computed correctly, can turn out to be wrong because of rounding issues)

Problem Introduction
You are organizing a funny competition for children. As a prize fund you have 𝑛 candies. You would like to use these candies for top 𝑘 places in a competition with a natural restriction that a higher place gets a larger number of candies. To make as many children happy as possible, you are going to find the largest value of 𝑘 for which it is possible.
Problem Description
Task. The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer 𝑛 as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be written as 𝑎1+𝑎2+···+𝑎𝑘 where𝑎1,...,𝑎𝑘 arepositiveintegersand𝑎𝑖 ̸=𝑎𝑗 forall1≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑘.
Input Format. The input consists of a single integer 𝑛.
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 109.
Output Format. In the first line, output the maximum number 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be represented as a sum of 𝑘 pairwise distinct positive integers. In the second line, output 𝑘 pairwise distinct positive integers that sum up to 𝑛 (if there are many such representations, output any of them).
